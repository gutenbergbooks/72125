<h2>Chapter <abbr title="One">I</abbr></h2>
<h3>The Poppelty-Poppetts</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Nibbles Poppelty-Poppett</span> was a nice,
plump, little mouse, with bright
black eyes, and a silky coat of soft
gray fur.</p>

<p>He lived with his mother, and
his sisters and brothers, down a
green lane near the river. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
were Sniffy and Snuffy, the twins,
who were always having colds together;
Gobble, who, I am sorry to
say, was very greedy,
and Little Topsy,
the baby.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_08.jpg"
 alt="Mouse family">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>Nibbles’s father had come to a
most untimely end in a mouse-trap,
into which he had been beguiled
by a too attractive bit of toasted
cheese.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_09.jpg"
 alt="Wash on a clothesline">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>Poor Mrs. Poppelty-Poppett had
then been obliged to move into a
wee, little cottage,
where she did cooking
and washing to
support her children.
Her apple-seed cookies, pine-cone
and maple sugar roly-poly, and
cheese and acorn pies were quite
famous among all the little squirrels,
mice, and rabbits of the neighboring
woods.</p>

<p>She had a tiny mite of a shop, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
the front part of her house, where
Ruddy Squirrel, Frisky Bushy-Tail,
and Bobtail and Rosamund Bunnikins-Bunny
spent all their pennies
on cakes and goodies.</p>

<p>It made Nibbles very unhappy to
have his mother work so hard, although
he did his best to help her;
so at last he decided to go out into
the world and seek his fortune.</p>

<p>One fine morning, bright and
early, he kissed the family good-bye,
and away he went, after making Sniffy,
Snuffy, and Gobble promise to be
good children and mind their mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Poppelty-Poppett, shedding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
many tears, had made a little bundle
of his clothes, neatly tied up in
a red bandanna handkerchief, which
Nibbles easily carried over his shoulder,
at the end of a stick.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_11.jpg"
 alt="Nibbles walking outdoors">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>At first he
felt very sad
and lonely,
but the sun was so warm, and
the crickets and birds were singing
so gayly, that he soon cheered
up, and trotted briskly along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>Towards noon Nibbles began to
feel so very hungry that he decided
it must be about dinner time. Not
far off he saw, beneath a shady elm
tree, a neat, cosy-looking house.
From a branch of the tree there
hung a sign, on which was written
in large gold letters:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">The Guinea Pigs’ Rest.</span><br>
</p>

<p>“That is just the place for me,”
thought Nibbles, “for I am fond of
guinea pigs.”</p>

<h2>Chapter II</h2>
<h3><i>The</i> Guinea Pigs’ Rest</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_13.jpg"
 alt="Chapter 2 header">
</div><!--end figcenter-->
</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> front of the inn, leaning comfortably
back in his chair, with his
feet up against the door post, sat a
fat, black and white guinea pig.
When Nibbles went up to ask him
if he could have some dinner, he
saw that Mr. Guinea Pig was fast
asleep, and snoring loudly.</p>

<p>“It is a pity to wake him,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
thought Nibbles, “but I am awfully
hungry; and besides, his mouth is
so wide open that he might easily
swallow a wasp.”</p>

<p>Nibbles coughed, and then he
whistled, but the Guinea Pig never
stirred. Finally, in desperation,
Nibbles got a straw, and began to
tickle his nose.</p>

<p>First Mr. Guinea Pig twitched
his nose, then he opened one eye;
at last he gave such a tremendous
sneeze that he nearly fell out of his
chair, and with a snort he woke up.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said he angrily. “What
do <em>you</em> want? This is the third time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>this morning that I have been waked
up, and I’m sleepy and want my nap.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_14a.jpg"
 alt="Nibbles and Guinea Pig at hearth">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>“Excuse me,” answered Nibbles
timidly, “but I am very hungry, and
should like to have some dinner.”</p>

<p>“Well, go into the house and get
the Salamander,” growled Mr.
Guinea Pig. And before Nibbles
could ask another question, he was
sound asleep again, and snoring
away as hard as ever.</p>

<p>“I wonder <em>what</em> the Salamander
is?” thought Nibbles. “It sounds
like a sandwich or a salad. The
thing is to find it.”</p>

<p>As Mr. Guinea Pig completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
blocked the front doorway, Nibbles
had to hunt about until he at
last found another entrance. Then
he wandered down a long hall with
empty rooms on either side, but no
Salamander could he find.</p>

<p>Finally he heard a squeaking and
a squealing, which seemed to come
from a room at the end of the hall.
He knocked gently on the door,
but, as no one answered, he ventured
to peep in.</p>

<p>A bright fire was burning in the
fireplace, in spite of its being a summer
day, so the room felt very hot.</p>

<p>On a footstool in front of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
fire, sat two tiny guinea pigs, who
had evidently just been washed, and
were now being dried. Their hair
had been carefully curled, and each
had a blue ribbon tied around its
neck in a big bow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Guinea Pig held on her lap
a third little pig, whose hair she
was curling, while the
littlest piggy of all was
sitting in the bathtub.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_17.jpg"
 alt="Mrs. Guinea Pig washing babies">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Nibbles
politely, “but can you please tell me
where I can find the Salamander?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Guinea Pig, whose back was
to the door, gave such a jump that
she nearly dropped the little pig.</p>

<p>“Oh, come right in,” she said
pleasantly, when she saw Nibbles. “I
am delighted to see you, only please
close the door, as I don’t like a draft.”</p>

<p>Nibbles thought a draft of fresh
air was very much needed, but he
said nothing, and closed the door.</p>

<p>“You will find the Salamander
in the kitchen,” said Mrs. Guinea
Pig. “He ought to be cooking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
the dinner, but he probably is
asleep, as the heat from the stove
seems to go to his head.”</p>

<div class="figright">
 <img src="images/i_19.jpg"
 alt="Guinea pig falls into washtub">
</div><!--end figright-->


<p>Just then there was a sudden
splash and a loud squeal. While Mrs.
Guinea Pig had been talking to Nibbles,
one of the little pigs had jumped
off the footstool,
and had come over
to see what the littlest
piggy was doing.
He had climbed up
on the edge of the
tub, and then had
slipped, and fallen into the water,
right on top of the baby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Guinea Pig was very angry
with the naughty little pig for
being disobedient, and also for
spoiling its best blue bow. While
she was giving him a shaking, the
piggy on her lap fell onto the floor,
and then there was such a squeaking
and a squealing that Nibbles
ran out of the room, without even
waiting to say good-bye.</p>

<h3>The Salamander</h3>


<div class="figcenter">

 alt="Chapter 3 header">
</div><!--end figcenter-->
</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Nibbles</span> was sorry that he had not
asked where the kitchen was, but
he preferred to hunt it up himself
rather than to go back to Mrs.
Guinea Pig’s hot bath-room, and
after a little while he found it.</p>

<p>The tea-kettle was boiling cheerily
on the stove, and Nibbles noticed
a delicious odor of toasted
cheese and bacon, but nowhere
could he see the Salamander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<div class="figleft">
 <img src="images/i_22.jpg"
 alt="Nibbles looking in coalhob">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>He looked in the cupboard and
under the sink, behind the door
and under the table, in the coalhod
and behind the
stove, until at last,
being very hungry,
he began to call:
“Mr. Salamander!
Oh, Mr. Salamander!”</p>

<p>At once he heard
a sleepy, squeaky voice saying:
“Yes, yes, I’ll get up in a minute.
Is it time for breakfast already?”</p>

<p>The voice came from the stove, and,
to Nibbles’s amazement, he saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
oven door slowly open, and the most
curious looking animal with a very
sleepy face jump out. It looked like
a fat black lizard, with large flame-color
spots, bright black eyes, and
queer, short
little legs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_23.jpg"
 alt="Salamander">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>After giving such a prodigious
yawn that Nibbles was afraid that
he might never be able to shut his
mouth again, he looked at Nibbles
and said very sadly: “Oh, dear!
I was having such a lovely dream
when you woke me up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“I am very sorry,” replied Nibbles,
“but I am so hungry that I
shall soon be ready to eat my
whiskers.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the Salamander,
“you sha’n’t wait another minute”;
and he bustled about so fast
that, before he knew it, Nibbles was
eating large quantities of cheese
and bacon pie, and drinking cups
of tea so hot that it made him
wink.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Salamander had
climbed up on top of the stove,
where he sat with his feet hanging
over the edge, nodding and dozing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_25.jpg"

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_26.jpg"
 alt="Salamander on the stove">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>“Do you <i>never</i> get too
hot?” inquired Nibbles.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” replied the
Salamander. “I belong to
a very chilly family. We are
all devoted to heat and poetry.
Would you like to hear my favorite
poem?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very much,” said Nibbles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>So the Salamander, in a high,
squeaky voice, began to recite:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“The Salamander loves to sit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the red-hot stove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And longs to clasp it in his arms,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherever he may rove.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“He likes the little scarlet flames</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That sparkle in the fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in a boiling tea-kettle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sees something to admire.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Do you remember what comes
next?” he inquired anxiously. “I
am afraid that I have forgotten.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Nibbles. “I am very
fond of singing, but I don’t know
any poetry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” yawned the Salamander,
“in that case, I think, if you
don’t mind, that I’ll take another
nap. Poetry always makes me very
sleepy.”</p>

<p>Then, curling his short little
arms around the tea-kettle, and
resting his head so near the spout
that Nibbles was afraid the steam
would blow it off, he began once
more to recite very drowsily.</p>

<p>By this time Nibbles had eaten
all that he possibly could, so he said
good-bye to the Salamander, who
paid no attention, and started off
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>As he trotted briskly down the
hall, he could still hear the Salamander
murmuring sleepily to himself:
“He—&#8203;likes—&#8203;the—&#8203;lit—tle—&#8203;scar—let——&#8203;flames——&#8203;which——”
and then nothing
more; so he must have gone
fast asleep.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Nibbles</span> spent
the night in a
cosy nest which he
found in a hazel bush,
and early the next morning he was
off once more on his travels.</p>

<p>Towards noon, while he was
picking acorns for dinner, whom
should he see, running along the
road, but his cousin, Teenie Weenie,
the dearest little white mouse
in the world?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“Hullo, Teenie Weenie!” called
Nibbles. “Where did you come
from?”</p>

<p>“Why, I live in a village not far
from here,” replied Teenie Weenie.
“And where are you going, Cousin
Nibbles?”</p>

<p>“I am going to seek my fortune,”
said Nibbles.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>do</em> let me come, too,”
begged Teenie.</p>

<p>“All right, come along,” answered
Nibbles. “Two is company
and one is none. Only don’t
keep getting tired.”</p>

<p>“No, I certainly won’t,” promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
Teenie. “But you must come
and have supper at my house before
we start.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>By the time
they reached
the village, it was
dark, and the lights
in the houses were beginning
to shine. They crept
cautiously down the street until
they came to a pretty house in the
middle of a large garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_33.jpg"
 alt="Scaling the garden wall">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>“That is where I
live,” said Teenie Weenie,
“but look out for the Cat.”</p>

<p>A brightly lighted window
was open, around
which grew a honeysuckle.
Up the vine ran
Teenie Weenie, closely
followed by Nibbles, and,
sitting on the windowsill,
they looked into a
beautiful room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>On a long table there were
numbers of lighted candles in high
silver candle-sticks, and never had
Nibbles seen such wonderful things
to eat,—nuts and raisins, figs and
dates, oranges and grapes, cakes and
candy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_34.jpg"
 alt="Table of food">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>In a moment, Teenie Weenie
and Nibbles had run across the
room and jumped up on the table.
Nibbles tried first one thing and
then another, each tasting better
than the last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly Teenie Weenie gave a
little gasp of terror, which startled
Nibbles so that he nearly fell into a
finger-bowl.</p>

<p>“What <em>is</em> the matter, Teenie?”
he asked, rather crossly, for in his
fright he had dropped a particularly
nice bit of cake on the floor.</p>

<p>“The Cat,” whispered Teenie
Weenie, in a terrified
voice.</p>

<div class="figright">
 <img src="images/i_35.jpg"
 alt="Nibbles and Teenie Weenie">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>Nibbles looked
around, and suddenly
he saw, in
a chair close by,
a big gray and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
white animal, which was evidently
just waking up, and was stretching
itself and yawning. Such terrible
teeth and sharp claws as it had!</p>

<p>While Nibbles gazed at it, too
frightened to move, the Cat turned
around, and its green eyes glared
as it saw the two trembling little
mice.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_36a.jpg"
 alt="Cat, yawning">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>Before the sleepy Cat could
jump on the table however, Nibbles
and Teenie Weenie were on
the floor, and an instant later they
were fairly tumbling out of the
window into the garden. Down
the village street they ran, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>never stopped until they were safe
in the open country once more.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Nibbles, “I have
never seen a Cat before, and I sincerely
hope that I never may again.
You may live in a village if you
like, Teenie Weenie, but I prefer
the quiet woods.”</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">They</span> traveled on
for several days, close to the
river, until Nibbles suggested
that it would be more fun and
easier to sail than to walk.</p>

<p>They at once began to make a
little raft with willow twigs and bits
of birch bark, and to prevent the
water coming through, they filled up
the cracks with clay. The big bandanna
handkerchief they used as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
sail, and with his jack-knife Nibbles
whittled out a nice little rudder.</p>

<p>One warm, sunny day, they
hoisted their sail and were just
starting off, when they heard some
one shouting. Looking around,
they saw, on the bank above them,
a big gray Rat, waving his hat and
calling: “Wait a minute, and take
me with you.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry,” answered
Nibbles, “but the raft is small and
there is not room enough.”</p>

<p>“But I <i>will</i> go,” shouted the
Water Rat very rudely, “and I am
in a hurry too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>Poor Teenie Weenie was frightened,
for she knew that Water Rats
sometimes ate mice, especially if
they were cross or very hungry, so
she begged Nibbles not to go near
the shore.</p>

<p>As they sailed away, the Water
Rat, I regret to say, danced with
rage, making frightful faces at Nibbles
and Teenie Weenie, and saying
things which were not at all polite.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_40a.jpg"
 alt="Raft and rat">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>Day after day they sailed down
the winding river, sometimes landing
for dinner, and at night always
tying their raft to a tree or bush in
some sheltered cove, where they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>could find a comfortable nest to
sleep in.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_41.jpg"
 alt="Raft and alligator">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>One afternoon they came to a
pretty wood, where they decided to
spend the night. Near the bank
was a dark, gravelly point, which
seemed an excellent place to land.
Nibbles got out, and was just beginning
to pull the raft up high and
dry, when suddenly the whole point
began to move, and then something
struck poor Nibbles, and sent him
whizzing far out into the river.</p>

<p>Down down, down he sank, until
he felt sure that he was going through
to China. His head was buried in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
soft sand at the bottom of the river,
and he had to struggle hard to free
himself. Finally he came up to the
surface of the water, and was able
to swim to the raft, where little
Teenie Weenie still sat, too terrified
to move.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Floating</span> on the water,
so near the raft that he
could have touched it, Nibbles saw
a huge animal covered with brown
scales. It had small black eyes,
and a long tail, while its head was
mostly made up of a very long
nose, and a huge mouth full of
sharp teeth.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said the Animal, “I
thought you were never coming up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
What kept you so long under the
water?”</p>

<p>Poor Nibbles was dripping wet,
covered with sand, and still gasping for
breath, but he tried to answer politely:</p>

<p>“I could not come up any sooner,
Sir, because my head was stuck in
the sand. Will you please tell me
what you are? I thought you were
a landing place.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” replied the Animal,
“my name is Scratchetty-Claw, and
I am an Alligator of a very fine old
family. I have lived in this river for
a hundred years, and I probably
shall live a thousand. I am very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
sorry that I upset you, but I thought
a fly had lighted on my back, so I
swished my tail, and I am afraid
that you rolled off.”</p>

<p>“I certainly did,” said Nibbles
sadly, as he tried to wipe the sand
out of his eyes and ears.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_46.jpg"
 alt="Alligator, Nibbles and Teenie Weenie">
</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>Suddenly Mr. Scratchetty-Claw
opened his eyes very
wide, and staring at
Nibbles, he shouted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“Why, <em>what</em> have you got around
your neck?”</p>

<p>Nibbles put up his paw, and, sure
enough, there was something which
felt like a ring. How it came there
he could not imagine, but he must
have pushed his head through it
while he was floundering in the sand
at the bottom of the river.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_48.jpg"
 alt="Ring on Nibbles' head'">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Teenie Weenie helped him pull
it off, and when they had brushed
the sand away, they found that it
was a gold ring, beautifully carved,
and set with diamonds and rubies.</p>

<p>“That must surely be the Lucky
Ring of the foreign Prince, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
owns all this part of the country,”
said the Alligator. “He lost it one
day last summer, while out sailing,
and nobody was able to find it. The
Prince offered a big reward for its
recovery, as he prized the ring more
than anything he owned.”</p>


<p>“Then we must take it to him as
soon as we can,” said Nibbles.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning Nibbles asked
Mr. Scratchetty-Claw where the
Prince lived.</p>

<p>“Just fasten your raft to my tail,”
said the Alligator, “and I’ll take
you there before you know that
you’ve started. Only wait until I
get my shade hat, as I don’t like the
sun in my eyes.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t go too fast, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
Scratchetty-Claw,” said little Teenie
Weenie, timidly, “or we might
be upset again.”</p>

<p>Scratchetty-Claw promised to be
very careful, and after he had tied
on his shade hat, and Nibbles had
fastened the raft to his tail, away
they went.</p>

<p>The Prince’s beautiful garden
was close to the river, so when Nibbles
and Teenie Weenie landed, they
soon found their way to his palace.</p>

<p>Nibbles had put the ring around
his neck again for safe keeping, but
when he showed it to a footman
in the palace hall, he took Nibbles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
and Teenie Weenie
at once to the Prince,
who was sitting in a
lovely rose arbor in
the garden.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>After taking off
his hat, and making a low bow,
Nibbles said:</p>

<p>“I think I have found your lordship’s
ring, which you lost. I have
it around my neck.”</p>

<p>The Prince lifted Nibbles up,
and looked at the ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“That is most surely my Lucky
Ring,” said he. “Where did you
find it?”</p>

<p>“In the sand at the bottom of the
river,” answered Nibbles, and he
told the Prince how nearly drowned
he had been, and about Mr. Scratchetty-Claw.</p>

<p>“My old friend, the Alligator,”
laughed the Prince. “Oh, I know
him well, the lazy scamp, for he
eats up all my best trout.”</p>

<p>Then he took the ring carefully
from Nibbles’s neck, and put it on
his own finger.</p>

<p>“You have given me back what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
I prize most in the world,” he said,
“and your reward shall be in proportion.
Every year, as long as you
live, you shall receive a bag of gold.”</p>

<p>Nibbles was almost too happy to
speak, but he thanked the Prince
and kissed his hand. A page was
sent to bring the gold, and a few
minutes later, Nibbles and Teenie
Weenie, carrying the precious bag
between them, were hurrying back
to the raft.</p>

<p>They found Mr. Scratchetty-Claw
fast asleep, but Nibbles, dancing with
joy, woke him up to hear the great
news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“Good enough!” said the Alligator.
“It’s a lucky thing for you
that I tipped you into the river.”</p>

<p>“It certainly was,” said Nibbles,
“for now my mother will never have
to work any more. Let us hurry
home to her as fast as we can,
Teenie Weenie.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take you part of the way,”
yawned Mr. Scratchetty-Claw, “although
I am fearfully sleepy.”</p>

happy as two little mice could be.</p>

<p>Mr. Scratchetty-Claw towed them
for a long way, until he became so
sleepy that he had to stop and take
a nap. He shed tears when he said
good-bye to Nibbles and Teenie
Weenie, but he soon settled himself
comfortably on a mud bank in a
shady spot, and in two minutes was
snoring so loudly that you could
have heard him half a mile away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>Nibbles and Teenie hoisted their
sail, and, as they floated along,
Teenie Weenie sang this song:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
For more than a week they sailed
up the pretty river, but at last, one
afternoon at sunset, they reached
home. Quietly they stole up to the
cottage and peeped in at the window.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_58.jpg"

<p>There was Mrs.

cooking supper,
while Sniffy and
Snuffy were peeling
potatoes, and Gobble
was eating an apple
behind the door.</p>

<p>Nibbles tapped gently on the
window-pane, and Mrs. Poppelty-Poppett
turned quickly around.
With a squeak of perfect delight,
she cried: “Oh, here is Nibbles!”
and ran to the door, upsetting the
soup-kettle right into the fire in her
haste. Of course, Sniffy and Snuffy,
Gobble and the baby, all ran out,
too, and then they all talked together
so fast that no one knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
what any one else was saying.
Pretty soon they quieted down, and
Nibbles told them of his wonderful
adventures, and of the finding of the
Lucky Ring. When he gave his
mother the bag of gold, poor little
Mrs. Poppelty-Poppett did not
know whether to laugh or cry with
happiness, so she did both. She had
worked hard for her children, and
now there would be comfort and
plenty for the rest of her life.</p>

up!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Nibbles.
“Teenie Weenie and I would far

soup.”</p>

<p>So they all helped, and in a few
minutes everything was ready; and
how good the supper tasted!</p>

<p>When at last they went to bed,
they all dreamed of bags of Lucky
Rings, and rivers of gold, guarded
by Alligators, who ate nothing but
toasted cheese and corn bread.</p>
